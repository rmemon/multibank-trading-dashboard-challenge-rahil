# [Frontend / Fullstack] Coding Challenge: Real-Time Trading Dashboard

## Objective

Design and implement a real-time trading dashboard that displays live ticker prices and interactive charts for selected financial instruments.

---

## Scope

### 1. Backend Service _(NodeJS)_

Build a microservice that:

- **Simulates or connects to a mock market data feed**  
  (e.g., WebSocket or polling)
- **Streams real-time price updates** for a set of tickers  
  (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, BTC-USD, etc...)
- **Exposes a RESTful API to:**
  - List available tickers
  - Fetch historical price data _(mocked)_
  - Subscribe to real-time updates via WebSocket

---

### 2. Frontend Dashboard _(React + TypeScript)_

Create a dashboard UI that:

- Displays a list of tickers with live price updates
- Shows a real-time chart for a selected ticker  
  _(e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts)_
- Allows users to switch between tickers
- Includes basic styling and responsiveness

---

### 3. Architecture & Design

- Use a microservices-friendly structure
- Apply clean code principles and separation of concerns
- Include basic unit tests for backend logic
- Use Docker for containerization

---

### Bonus Features _(Optional)_

- Add user authentication _(mocked)_
- Implement caching for historical data
- Add alerting for price thresholds
- Deploy using Kubernetes manifests

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and structure
- Real-time data handling
- API and WebSocket implementation
- UI responsiveness and interactivity
- Test coverage and documentation
- Bonus features and overall polish

## Submission Details

Please submit your solution via a **GitHub repository** link. The repository should include:

- A clear `README.md` file with:
  - Project overview
  - Any assumptions or trade-offs made
  - Instructions for running tests
  - Notes on bonus features (if implemented)
